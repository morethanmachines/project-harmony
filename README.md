## Wine Australia Project Harmony
This repository contains the artefacts for Wine Australia's Project Harmony. Project Harmony aims to define a standard schema for row/block identification and spray diary evidence.

## Contributing
You are welcome to contribute to this repository, and we encourage you to do so. Contributing to this project works like contributing to an open source project:

* Your contributions become part of the project; you can't enforce your own copyright over them.
* Please don't submit contributions that would breach confidentiality, non-disclosure, or controlled intellectual property rights.

## Providing feedback and asking questions
The Issues section of this repository is the best place to ask questions and provide feedback. We prefer this approach to using email because all collaborators can participate and learn from the discussion.

* Please use the issue search to see if anyone else has logged the same issue before adding yours.
* Do participate by commenting on issues logged by others.
* If you have several disparate items of feedback, please create separate issues to allow the discussion to progress for each. We will close issues once they have been resolved.
