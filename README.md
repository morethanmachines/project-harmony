# Wine Australia Spray Diary Specification

[![Import Latest Australian Grapevine Variety List](https://github.com/morethanmachines/project-harmony/actions/workflows/import-variety-list.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/morethanmachines/project-harmony/actions/workflows/import-variety-list.yml)

## Objective:
**Responding to industry requirements, [Wine Australia](https://www.wineaustralia.com/about-us) has created a data specification that is intended to support the portability of  grower agrochemical application records between Spray Diary systems.**

Adoption of this common specification by applications will enable growers to enter their agrochemical data once, share their data across platforms to permitted parties, and to maintain access to their online diary history. 

This repository contains the artefacts required for the adoption of the specification and extends the work undertaken by the [Collabraculture initiative](https://www.wineaustralia.com/research/projects/collabriculture-an-open-and-collaborative-approach-to-technology-in-the-wine-industry). 

The documents in this repository provide:

1. üçá [Specifications for row/block identifiers and spray diary data](https://github.com/morethanmachines/project-harmony/tree/main/specifications)
3. üß∞ [Tools that support the adoption of the specifications](https://github.com/morethanmachines/project-harmony/tree/main/tools)
