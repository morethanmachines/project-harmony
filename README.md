## Wine Australia Project Harmony
This repository contains the artefacts for Wine Australia's Project Harmony. Project Harmony aims to define a standard schema for row/block identification and spray diary evidence.

The best place to start reviewing the schema is the [project introduction](https://github.com/morethanmachines/project-harmony/blob/724472845a08312f402317f1a53b3c91260dd7ce/specifications/introduction.md).

## Contributing
You are welcome to contribute to this repository, and we encourage you to do so. Contributing to this project works like contributing to any open source project:

* Your contributions become part of the project; you can't enforce your own copyright over them.
* Please don't submit contributions that would breach confidentiality, non-disclosure, or controlled intellectual property rights.

Documents in the repository are formatted using [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). A guide to markdown formatting can be found [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github-ae@latest/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/about-writing-and-formatting-on-github)

## Providing feedback and asking questions
The [Issues section of this repository](https://github.com/morethanmachines/project-harmony/issues) is the best place to ask questions and provide feedback. We prefer this approach to using email because all collaborators can participate and learn from the discussion.

* Please use the issue search to see if anyone else has logged the same issue before adding yours.
* Do participate by commenting on issues logged by others.
* If you have several disparate items of feedback, please [create](https://github.com/morethanmachines/project-harmony/issues/new) separate issues to allow the discussion to progress for each. We will close issues once they have been resolved.
